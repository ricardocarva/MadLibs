# MadLibs

In C#, variables and string interpolation allow us to transform a piece of text by swapping out different pieces of information.

In this project, weâ€™ll use C# to write a Mad Libs word game! Mad Libs are short stories with blanks for the player to fill in that represent different parts of speech. The end result is a really hilarious and strange story.
Mad Libs require: A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words). Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

For this project, we have provided the story, but it will be up to you to complete the following: Prompt the user for inputs. Print the story with the inputs in the right places.
